# Screenshots Plan (Evidence Checklist)
## Ocean View Resort – Online Room Reservation System (Java EE / Tomcat / WAMP)

## Purpose
This document lists the screenshots that will be captured as evidence to prove:
- correct distributed Java EE system design decisions,
- correct UML application and architecture alignment,
- correct use of database and connection strategy,
- validation and error handling quality,
- testing strategies and 50 test cases evidence,
- version control under the Unified Process (UP).

Each screenshot is mapped to a marking requirement to ensure full coverage.

---

### SS-B5 — Sequence Diagram 3 (Generate Bill)
**What it proves:**
- Correct billing flow and service responsibility

---

# C) Distributed Architecture + Server Evidence (Task B)

### SS-C1 — Architecture diagram (3-tier)
Show:

**What it proves:**
- Architecture justification aligned with theory

---

### SS-C2 — Tomcat running (manager/app list or console)
**What it proves:**
- System is deployed and running on Tomcat

---

### SS-C3 — Application running in browser (simple UI is fine)
**What it proves:**
- Presentation layer works
- User interaction available

---

### SS-C4 — Console output from a “service class” (optional but strong)
Example:
- Print reservation details
- Print bill
- Print validation errors

**What it proves:**
- Business logic layer functions independently of UI
- Supports separation of concerns

---

# D) Database Evidence (Task B)

### SS-D1 — WAMP control panel showing MySQL running
**What it proves:**
- Database environment is operational

---

### SS-D2 — phpMyAdmin showing created database
**What it proves:**
- Proper database setup

---

### SS-D3 — Table structure screenshot (users, guests, reservations, room_types)
**What it proves:**
- Normalisation, constraints, correct schema

---

### SS-D4 — Sample data rows screenshot
Show inserted reservation records

**What it proves:**
- Persistence is working
- Data is stored correctly

---

### SS-D5 — DB connection configuration evidence
Depending on approach:
- DriverManager config screenshot OR
- Tomcat JNDI DataSource config screenshot

**What it proves:**
- Professional connection decision implemented

---

# E) Validation + Error Handling Evidence (Task B + Quality)

### SS-E1 — Validation: empty required fields
Example:
- empty guest name
- empty contact number

**What it proves:**
- Validation rules restrict invalid entries (explicit requirement)

---

### SS-E2 — Validation: invalid date order
Example:
- check-out before check-in

**What it proves:**
- Prevents invalid state and billing errors

---

### SS-E3 — Friendly error message screenshot (DB down / invalid search)
**What it proves:**
- Error handling is user-friendly and professional

---

# F) Testing Evidence (Task C)

### SS-F1 — Test plan table screenshot (document)
**What it proves:**
- Formal QA planning exists

---

### SS-F2 — JUnit unit tests passing (green)
**What it proves:**
- Automation evidence
- Unit testing strategy is applied

---

### SS-F3 — Integration test evidence (DB changes)
Example:
- insert reservation, then show record exists in DB

**What it proves:**
- Integration testing is performed and verified

---

### SS-F4 — System test evidence (end-to-end flow)
Example:
- Login → Add reservation → View reservation → Generate bill

**What it proves:**
- Full workflow meets requirements

---

### SS-F5 — 50 test case evidence pack (folder screenshot)
Include:
- `test-cases-50.md`
- screenshot files named TC01, TC02…

**What it proves:**
- Completeness and compliance with test volume requirement

---

# G) Reports + Value-Added Evidence (Bonus for 90+)

### SS-G1 — Reservations summary report output
Example:
- list of reservations
- upcoming check-ins
- occupancy summary

**What it proves:**
- Added value beyond minimum requirements

---

### SS-G2 — Billing report / revenue estimate (optional)
**What it proves:**

---

# H) Final Submission Evidence (Transition Phase)

### SS-H1 — “Final run” screenshot
Show:
- application running correctly
- key features accessible

---

### SS-H2 — Final GitHub link + last commit screenshot
**What it proves:**
- Final version is delivered and traceable

---

# Screenshot Naming Standard (IMPORTANT)
All screenshots should be saved inside:
`/docs/screenshots/`

Naming format:
- `SS-A1_GitHubRepo.png`
- `SS-B2_ClassDiagram.png`
- `TC01_ValidLogin.png`
- `TC11_AddReservationValid.png`

This naming makes your evidence easy for the marker to verify quickly.

---

# Summary
This evidence plan ensures every marking area is supported with traceable proof:
- UML quality
- architecture decisions
- database and connection strategy
- validation and robustness
- testing depth (strategies + 50 cases)
- version control under Unified Process
- professional documentation
