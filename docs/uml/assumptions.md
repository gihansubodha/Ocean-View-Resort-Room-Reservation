A1. Actors & roles

Receptionist performs daily operations (login, add/view reservation, generate bill, help, exit).

Admin manages reports and user accounts (optional).

A2. Reservation number

Reservation number is unique and generated by the system (reduces human error, ensures uniqueness).

A3. Date rules

checkOutDate must be after checkInDate.

Nights = difference in days between check-in and check-out.

A4. Room types & rates

Room types: SINGLE, DOUBLE, FAMILY, SUITE.

Rates are stored in DB (RoomType.ratePerNight) and are the single source of truth.

A5. Validation

Validation is performed at UI boundary (user friendliness) and service layer (defensive programming / cannot be bypassed by another client).

A6. Distributed design

Client (browser/JSP UI) calls JAX-RS web services over HTTP.

Web services call service layer → DAO → DB (WAMP/MySQL).
